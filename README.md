### ***Description***
#### This is a game to test your memory! When the game is started, cards will appear face down. To start the game, simply choose a card and click on it. The card will flip over and reveal an image. Click on any other card to reveal it's image. If the two cards have the same image, you have found a match and the cards will be removed from the board. If the two cards do not have the same image, you have not found a match and the cards will flip back over and remain on the board. Continue choosing cards until you find all the matches and all the cards have been removed. Upon completion of the game, a Replay button will appear. Good luck!
