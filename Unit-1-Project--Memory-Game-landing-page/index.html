  <h1>Welcome to the Picnic Memory Game</h1>
  <p>You are taking your friend to a picnic - remember to bring two of each snack!</p>
  <p>When the game is opened, a board will appear with 16 cards containing images of picnic baskets. The opposite sides of the cards contain images of fruits and vegetables. There are 8 pairs of cards. The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs by remembing their locations on the board.  </p>
